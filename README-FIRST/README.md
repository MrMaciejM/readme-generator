## Description

I have been tasked with creating a README.md generator terminal application using Node.js and "inquirer" library to make the process of creating README.md files more efficient for a developer.

The app uses inquirer library and presents several prompts upon being initiated with "node index.js" from the terminal.

## Usage

To use the app you need to install Node.js and NPM package manager. you will also need inquirer with the 8.2.5 version. Once those pre-requisites are complete, you can initiate the README.md generator with "node index.js" from the terminal.
